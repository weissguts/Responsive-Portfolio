    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img src="assets/images/dan_profile_pic.png" class="auth-image" alt="Daniel Hernandez">

    <p>I am originally from El Paso TX and moved to Denver, CO about seven years ago. I worked for about 3.5 years
      in the television industry as a graphics artist and production assistant. After moving to Denver CO I entered
      the financial services industry working for Transamerica. I have spent the last 6.5 years there with the last
      three being in management. I am currently going back to school at Regis University pursuing a B.S. in
      Computer Science. In addition to this I am enrolled in a coding bootcamp hosted at Denver University specializing
      in web development.</p>

    <p>Last year I completed a team based race called the Wild West Relay. We ran from Fort Collins CO to
      Steamboat Springs CO. I ran about 23.5 miles total over the course of 36 hours.
      It was definitely one of the greatest experiences of my life; and once I finish school and the bootcamp
      program I will be back to pursuing fitness & running in my free time.</p>
